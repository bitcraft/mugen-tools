"""
Mugen select.def file creator with template support.


Features
--------

The script will search through a folder for characters and add them to a
new select.def file.  It will also search through stages and add them as well.

Characters will be grouped inside the select.def file by the subdirectory
they are in.  For example, characters in a "Street Fighter" folder will all
be together.  Headers are written in the file when a new group is started.

Template Support:
    The script can read in an existing select.def and add characters in the
    "randomselect" spots.


Usage
-----

* Copy this file into your MUGEN folder.
* Make a copy of select.def and move it to your MUGEN folder
* Rename the copy to "template.def"

* Run mkselectdef.py

mkselectdef.py will scan your chars folder and add any character it finds.
A new select.def file will be created in your MUGEN folder.

*** NOTE: duplicates are not checked ***


Rationale
---------

I have used this script to create massive screenpacks and to organize 6 gigs of
mugen characters.  Existing tools were too complex or buggy. 


Templates
---------

A "template" is simply a select.def file that this script will use to create
a new copy that includes new characters.

:: The template must be named "template.def"

By default, the script will replace any lines that begin with "randomselect"
with a new line that defines a new character.

I have used this template system to quickly add characters to screenpacks that
have complex layouts.


Limitations
-----------

This script does not check for duplicates and is not aware of any extra options
that may be needed for the screen, such as 'order', 'music', or 'includestage'.


Customization
-------------

This script includes a few variables that you may modify.  Look under
"OPTIONS" below.


Python Support
--------------

This script was developed and tested with python 2.7.3 on OS X.
