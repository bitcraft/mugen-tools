"""
see if a character works for a particular version of mugen

this high-tech, patented process uses advanced algorithms and
proprietary data structures resulting in time and money saved.
here's what it does:
  make list of all characters
  make match with first two characters in list
  if crashes, change player #1 with kfm
  if crashes, discard player #1
  if doesn't crash, change player #2 with kfm
  if crashes, discard player #2
  if it doesn't crash, then those two players have a problem
  repeat until no more characters

requires character 'kfm', since it is known to work 100%.
also, runs multiple copies of winmugen at once.
