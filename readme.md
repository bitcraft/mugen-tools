MUGEN Tools for Python
======================

Small project that adds some python code for performing mugen related tasks.


Features
--------

* select.def creator with template support
* SSF reading and image extraction
* frontend with random matchups

NOTE: I just set up this repository this week and the tools are under active
development (just started Oct. 13th).


Rationale
---------

I like python and some of the tools available in the community are just not
my style.


Python Support
--------------

This package was developed and tested with:
python 2.7.3, OS X 10.8.2, pygame 1.9.1
